In order to stack up the persistence merchanism:
	Parent-child relationship should be avoid.
	Instead, only parent will be placed inside child and we will use more query incase we want to fetch child by parent identity
	In case of persist a child entity (due to the synapticism of un-detachable entity), well, we should (or should not???) include parent information???
